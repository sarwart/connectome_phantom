# **Evaluation of tractogram filtering methods using human-like connectome phantoms**

This repository provides the neuroscience community with framework to simulate diffusion MRI. Details about the simulation process are reported in the paper.

[**demo.m**] file represents the main script that uses the files in the [**data**] folder to simulate the diffusion MRI along with the underlying connectivity matrix
